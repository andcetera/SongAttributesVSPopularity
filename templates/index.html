        <h1>About The Data</h1>
        <p>This dataset contains the top 200 songs from the Spotify 'Weekly Top Songs' charts for each country from the week of 02/04/2021 to 07/14/2022. Few key features which made this ideal for our project are its breakdown of artist names, track names, countries, weeks alongwith important attributes such as danceability, energy, key, mode, loudness, speechiness, acousticness, instrumentalness, liveness, valence, tempo and duration. We tailored the dataset to derive and create a homepage that shows some statistics and also dive deeper into 73 countries and their song attributes via choropleth. </p>
        <h1>About Spotify's Song Attributes</h1>
        <p>Attributes are defined by Spotify. Attributes included in our dataset are: 
        <ul>
            <li>Danceability — Danceability describes how suitable a track is for dancing based on a combination of musical elements including tempo, rhythm stability, beat strength, and overall regularity. A value of 0.0 is least danceable and 1.0 is most danceable.</li>
            <li>Energy — Energy is a measure from 0.0 to 1.0 and represents a perceptual measure of intensity and activity. Typically, energetic tracks feel fast, loud, and noisy. For example, death metal has high energy, while a Bach prelude scores low on the scale.</li>
            <li>Loudness — The overall loudness of a track in decibels (dB). Loudness values are averaged across the entire track and are useful for comparing relative loudness of tracks. Values typically range between -60 and 0 db.</li>
            <li>Speechiness - Speechiness detects the presence of spoken words in a track. The more exclusively speech-like the recording (e.g. talk show, audio book, poetry), the closer to 1.0 the attribute value. Values above 0.66 describe tracks that are probably made entirely of spoken words. Values between 0.33 and 0.66 describe tracks that may contain both music and speech, either in sections or layered, including such cases as rap music. Values below 0.33 most likely represent music and other non-speech-like tracks.</li>
            <li>Acousticness — A confidence measure from 0.0 to 1.0 of whether the track is acoustic. 1.0 represents high confidence the track is acoustic.</li>
            <li>Valence — A measure from 0.0 to 1.0 describing the musical positiveness conveyed by a track. Tracks with high valence sound more positive (e.g. happy, cheerful, euphoric), while tracks with low valence sound more negative (e.g. sad, depressed, angry).</li>
            <li>Tempo — The overall estimated tempo of a track in beats per minute (BPM). In musical terminology, tempo is the speed or pace of a given piece and derives directly from the average beat duration.</li>
            <li>Duration — The length of the song.</li>
        </ul>

            <h1>Song Attribute Distribution</h1>    
            <div class="center"><img src="static/Images/attribute1.png" alt="Song Attribute Distribution Chart"></div>
            <p>This graph shows the histograms display the distribution of specific attributes across all songs in the dataset. We can see that danceability is very spread-out with several modes and so is valence. On the other hand tempo, duration and energy have clustered peaks. Loudness is measured on a negative scale from 0 to -60 and -7 is median loudness.</p>

            <h1>Song Attribute Correlation</h1>    
            <div class="center"><img src="static/Images/heatmap.png" alt="Attribute correlation heat map"></div>
            <p>This heatmap shows the Pearson correlation that measures the strength of the linear relationship between two variables. It has a value between -1 to 1, with a value of -1 meaning a total negative linear correlation, 0 being no correlation, and + 1 meaning a total positive correlation. For example, energy and danceability has a positive correlation at 0.62 which mean one is high the other will be high as well. On the other hand, tempo and duration have a negative correlation at -019 which means on affects the other negatively.</p>
