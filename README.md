Part 1: Exploratory Data Analysis and creating Data Frames

The initial data set required cleaning and filtering in order for it to be used for the future steps. Certain columns were removed due the the size,     which impacted the CSV being read. The columns that were used in the CSV were artist name, track name, rank, weeks on chart, streams, danceability, energy, loudness, speechiness, acousticness, valence, tempo, duration and country. The cleaned data set was then divided into different data frames which would then be used to make different tables. These data frames include


Part 2: Converting the data to sqlite Database


Part 3: Flask
